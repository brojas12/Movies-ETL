 Module 8 Challenge – Movies-ETL
 
**#Purpose**

       The purpose of this assignment was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate 
       
       transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We accompished this by taking in the three files—Wikipedia data, 
       
       Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performing the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL 
       
       database.
